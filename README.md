# Don't copy my entire blog settings and use it as your own blog

## What happened

Back in 2021, I found out there was a guy who [copied my entire blog settings and use it as his own blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20210508005620/https://malgamy.github.io/). You can see that he didn't even bother to change the avatar, which is really ridiculous.

## How did I found out

Since I used Google Analytics and Addthis in my blog, one day I just started to receive notifications about blogs that were clearly not written by me. By tracking the URL in Google Analytics, I discovered the blog and its GitHub page. Clearly he didn't change the IDs of Google Analytics and AddThis, which is why I received those notifications in the first place.

## What action did I take

First I did some research about the copyright issue for GitHub repository that doesn't have any license in it. Clearly according to [this post](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1720/what-can-i-assume-if-a-publicly-published-project-has-no-license), if a repository has no license, then **all rights are reserved**. Quote from the [GitHub's licensing help page](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository#choosing-the-right-license):


> ......You're under no obligation to choose a license. However, without a license, **the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work.**

I then filed an issue in this guy's github.io repository, explaining the situation. I didn't tell him to remove the blog or something like that, just asking him to change some settings in his blog so it won't messed up my Google Analytics and statistic data in my Addthis page.

## What happened after

He deleted the entire github.io repository without a single reply. Then, he created another github.io repository, and took another guys blog settings ( didn't bother to report it though since it's not my problem anymore ).

----

And this, is why I decided to change my blog settings and turn my github.io repository into private for almost two years. And now since my GitHub Pro coupon is due, I decide to open it again to public.

I'm totally OK if someone is using the same blog theme as mine, but it really annoys me to see someone that is too lazy to customize the blog himself and decide to just copy & paste the settings directly. **So, don't copy my entire blog settings and use it as your own blog. Spent some time and learn how to customize your own blog yourself.**
